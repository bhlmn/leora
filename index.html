									<p><em>"We were lucky to have Jenni come out and do a walk-through of our new home before anything was moved in so that we could get a better idea of where to put things when moving day came. I love that she took us step by step through the priorities of function and organization first, visual presentation second. I have loved working with Jenni and the results. I love coming home!"</em></p>

									<p><em>"Jenni is certainly energy efficient. One minute she was explaining her process and pretty soon, the piles that overwhelmed me were neatly organized effortlessly into places made just for them. The afternoon Jenni spent re-organizing my office felt like a conversational visit with a friend. Sheer joy. The bonus is that my desk can be called that again and its useable, clear surface makes me feel liberated and happy!"</em></p>

									<p><em>"I have to admit, I was nervous about the whole thing. It can be intimidating to have someone come in and see your home in all its chaotic glory. However, I was determined to have a better home—a place of peace and happiness for my family. Well, Jenni was bold, but not critical at all. I appreciated her honesty and the ideas that she had presented for organization and style that I had never considered before."</em></p>
