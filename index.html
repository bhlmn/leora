										<p>Home should be a safe place to relax and enjoy time with family. That relaxation is often interrupted by a never ending list of things to do. My services help reduce or even put an end to those interrupting lists.</p>
										<p>Decluttering, organizing, and decorating your home can make a world of difference. I can help you create organization systems that are easy to use and work for your everyday life. There are solutions to those struggles and burdens that are preventing you from loving your home, let me help you find them!</p>

									<h2>Behind the Name</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I chose the name <strong>Leora</strong> for my business because of the gift I want to share with you. Like the light at the end of a tunnel -- darkness fading as a warm comforting light takes over. A breath of fresh air. It’s this feeling that I want to give you -- the lifting of a heavy burden as you walk in your front door at the end of the day.</p>
								<p><em>How can I brighten your day?</em></p>
								<h2>It is worth it</h2><br>
								<p>There are many reasons why having a beautiful, happy home is important!  My services are an <em>investment</em>. Loving being home increases the likelihood of spending time in it. This <em>saves you money</em> in the long run, as being out and about all the time gets expensive quickly, especially with kids. My goal is to be as efficient with your resources as possible.  I am not going to make unnecessary, expensive recommendations or rack up hours of work that you are capable of completing on your own.  We will work together to determine your needs and construct a plan that works with your budget.</p>
								<p><em>In the end you will love your home!</em></p>

									<h2>Hi! I'm Jenni!</h2>
								</header>
								<form action="#" method="post">
									<div>
										<p>This might be a bit more detail than you'd expect. It’s all personal information about me. After all, we are going to be spending some time together. The more you understand where I’m coming from, the easier and more fun it will be to work together.</p>
										<p>I am a goal-oriented problem solver. I tend to approach problems analytically and resolve them creatively. These strengths have gotten me everywhere I have ever wanted to go. Now, I am ready to use them to help others make the changes they want to see.</p>
										<h3>Growing up</h3><br>
										<p>I started cleaning my own room as soon as I could walk. Needless to say, organizing comes very naturally to me. I am the oldest of three Air-Force Brats, all girls. Luckily, I had my own room most of the time. My parents had high standards and expectations of me, so I grew up fast, with a lot of responsibility. There was only one right way to do things and I often learned the hard way.</p>
										<p><em>As a result</em>, I am always careful not to push my standards or preferences on you. We work as a team to develop solutions that meet your needs, expectations, and standards. Your home should look and feel the way you want it to. That is my only objective and my highest priority.</p>
										<h3>Hight School</h3><br>
										<p>If we had gone to school together you would most likely not remember me. There is not much excitement in a small town and a high school with less than 500 students. I spent a lot of time on school work. I was in student government doing behind the scenes meetings with teachers and the school board. My efforts were focused on getting students motivated and involved in school activities. I played some volleyball, managed the wrestling team, and the boys’ varsity basketball team. Outside of school I spent time with a select few friends, caring for my siblings and working in the family coffee and ice cream shop. Pretty early on I took an interest in psychology and decided to make it a focus moving forward.</p>
										<p><em>As a result</em>, I work hard, stay focused, and look at the big picture to aim us in the right direction. Juggling multiple tasks and keeping a comfortable balance of creativity and productivity are skills that I find useful in organizing and redesigning.</p>
										<h3>College</h3><br>
										<p>Going into my undergrad I thought I wanted to be a counselor for at risk youth. I facilitated a support group at a nonprofit mental health organization. Working in retail at this time, I was frustrated by how much time was waisted and how unmotivated my coworkers were. When I started my junior year, I was introduced to Industrial and Organizational Psychology which took me in a whole new direction. Learning that I could channel my obsession with efficiency into a career was life changing. I finished my BS in Psychology and took a few years off to start my family. Before my second son turned a year old, I went back to school. The goal was to take it slow and be ready to work when he entered kindergarten in 2020. I graduated with my Masters in Human Resources Management in 2017. I enjoyed the program so much that I could not pick between classes. My interest in productivity, job satisfaction, motivation, and training pushed me to work harder and faster than I had anticipated.</p>
										<p><em>As a result</em>, I bring my knowledge of satisfaction, motivation, and productivity to support your commit to positive change. I bring an awareness of the emotional connections we have for our space and how they in turn impact how we feel. I bring my dedication and passion to do good and work hard. I bring the ability and willingness to adapt and adjust to change. I move quickly and with a purpose so you can move forward feeling confident and renewed. I bring my skills and experiences and use them to make necessary changes so that your experiences are positive and successful.</p>
										<h3>Now</h3><br>
										<p>It’s your turn to tell me about you! What is your background? Your personality? Your values? Your style? Your skills? Your needs? I have shared with you my history and development of this passion and skill set. How can I use it to brighten your world?</p>

									<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
								</header>
								<form action="#" method="post">
									<div>
										<p>If you are determined to do it on your own and just need a little extra push, these Tips and Tricks may be all you need. Each of these build upon one another, so the top is a great place to start!</p>
										<h3>Rally the Troops!</h3>
										<p>When it comes to having a beautifully organized home it’s important to keep key players in mind. You can’t do this alone. Is everyone in the home willing to commit to lasting change? Modifying behavior and habits is very challenging. Creating systems that are easy for all house members to use is just the first step. Modified communication can aid in the progression towards building good habits.</p>
										<h3>Respect the Space</h3>
										<p>Our homes and belongings are investments. Hard earned time and money has gone into every aspect of your home. And each piece has a purpose it was designed for. When we respect our spaces and our belongings by using them for their intended purpose, we extend their value and usefulness. Using them improperly breaks them down faster, meaning it will need to be replaced or repaired sooner.</p>
										<h3>Habits and Routines</h3>
										<p>There are many different areas that people struggle with in their homes. One I have encountered a lot is an untidy living space. If the first thing you see when you walk into your living room is things all over the floor, I might be able to help. I recommend creating a quick tidy up routine. This often means having some empty decorative baskets handy on a shelf. It takes little effort to grab one and fill up before heading out the door in the morning or before heading to bed at the end of the day. Another favorite of mine is finding a home for everything. Wouldn’t it be nice to always find what you are looking for? It is easier to find what you need when everything has a home. Of course, the key is to put it away after use. The last one I will share here is, let it go. When you find that you pick up the same broken toy that has not been played with but has merely been dumped out onto the floor for the third time today, toss it. I have seen so much time and energy wasted on picking up the same piece of rubbish over and over again.</p>
										<h3>Chore Chart</h3>
										<p>Most people have tried a chore chart already. If you have and you did not see much success, now is a good time to give it another chance. In combination with the first three tips, charts can add structure and accountability to these developing habits. Now you have 1) the family on board, 2) a mindset of respect, and 3) simple routines with systems that work. Your family is now set up to succeed with a maintenance schedule. If just one task gets done a day then the weekend is not spent catching up on a week’s worth of house work. Instead everyone gets to enjoy quality time together.</p>
										<h3>Boundaries</h3>
										<p>This one can be touchy for some people and that is understandable. What works for some might not work for all. That said, I would like to share some of what I have observed and tried myself. I was a stay at home mom for four years with two boys, very close in age. Kids are often blamed for the state of a home. But kids can learn to respect boundaries that are consistent and well explained. Learning that there is a time and place for certain behaviors do not need to be reserved for public spaces, they can be used at home as well.</p>
										<h3>Get Creative</h3>
										<p>Be resourceful, work with what you’ve got, take chances and shake things up. And if needs be, let me be your DIY buddy! If you have something you don’t use anymore see if you can repurpose it. Many of my clients have felt such joy from taking on a project and truly surprising themselves by what they can create. These creations often become the center of attention and the first thing they show their friends after the redesign is complete.</p>

										<p>Something that might be useful to keep in mind is that I don’t consider myself an interior designer. That is to say, I am less concerned with what is fashionable or “in”. I won’t recommend trendy art pieces or impractical furniture or expensive storage solutions. Additionally, my approach is a partnership and it requires <strong>your involvement and decision making</strong> every step of the way. My goal is to facilitate the changes you want to see in your space. This investment retains its value only if you commit to these systems and adjust behaviors and habits that allow them to hold up day to day. I can be as involved or not involved as you feel is necessary. I won’t require that I am present for installing and implementing the plans we design together, but if you feel you need the extra hand or moral support I will gladly be available to you. I make every effort to conserve your valuable resources.</p>
