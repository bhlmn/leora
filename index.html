Do you find yourself cutting lunch short to get back into the office, or calling it an early night because things need done at home? If so, this dread might be driving more of your behavior than you realize.</p>
						<p class="style1">I’d like to help you change that.</p>
						<p class="style1">Imagine looking forward to getting into work, and feeling ready to jump in right where you left off. Imagine getting to the end of your day and taking a deep breath as you walk in the door, happy to have made it home.</p> -->
						<p class="style2">My purpose is to enhance how you experience the spaces you spend your life in.</p>
						<p class="style1">By decluttering, organizing, rearranging, and even decorating, your space can be transformed into a functional and inspiring environment. Together we can create systems that work well <em>for you</em> and hold up over time, allowing you to focus on the things that matter most.</p>

												<p>This is a great option for those that feel as though the list of to-dos will never end. If you have found you don’t have enough storage, it may be that you have more things than you need. Purging before the holidays can be a great way to prepare for all the exciting new things that are coming your way.</p>

												<p>From decluttering, downsizing, and preparing to stage your home for sale, I would love to help make the transition into your new space as light as possible. Space planning and layout can be optimized by conducting a walk-through of the new location together before the movers arrive.</p>

												<p>My objective is to stay mindful of your resources. Some spaces contain small problem areas that can be transformed in one session while larger projects can require more elaborate designs. During your intake appointment we can discuss whether your needs are better suited for hourly or project-based rates.</p>

									<p><em>"We were lucky to have Jenni come out and do a walk-through of our new home before anything was moved in so that we could get a better idea of where to put things when moving day came. I love that she took us step by step through the priorities of function and organization first, visual presentation second. I have loved working with Jenni and the results. I love coming home!"</em></p>

									<p><em>"Jenni is certainly energy efficient. One minute she was explaining her process and pretty soon, the piles that overwhelmed me were neatly organized effortlessly into places made just for them. The afternoon Jenni spent re-organizing my office felt like a conversational visit with a friend. Sheer joy. The bonus is that my desk can be called that again and its useable, clear surface makes me feel liberated and happy!"</em></p>

									<h3><a href="#">Bedroom & Living Space</a></h3>
									<p><em>"I have to admit, I was nervous about the whole thing. It can be intimidating to have someone come in and see your home in all its chaotic glory. However, I was determined to have a better home—a place of peace and happiness for my family. Well, Jenni was bold, but not critical at all. I appreciated her honesty and the ideas that she had presented for organization and style that I had never considered before."</em></p>
