					<p class="text200">I’ve been told that I started cleaning my room as soon as I could walk. I guess organizing has always come naturally to me. My parents had high standards and expectations – there was only one way to do things and I often learned the hard way. So I grew up fast, with a lot of responsibility, and learned to embrace hard work. In high school I was enrolled in college classes; participated in student government, yearbook, and volleyball; and I helped manage the varsity wrestling and basketball teams. Outside of school I spent time with a select few friends, cared for my three younger siblings, and worked in the family coffee and ice cream shop.</p>

						<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
							<p class="text200">In college I focused on mental health awareness and fighting stigma with teens and young adults. I was working to become a counselor and facilitated a support group at a nonprofit mental health organization. Working in retail to help pay for school, I was frustrated by how much effort was wasted on inefficient systems and how unmotivated my coworkers were. When I started my junior year, I was introduced to Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Learning that I could channel my obsession with motivation, satisfaction and efficiency into a career was life changing. I finished my degree in Psychology from Portland State University with my sights set on management and leadership.</p>

						<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">
							<p class="text200">One cross country move, two kids, and three years later, I surprised myself by going back to school. I started the Human Resources Management program at the Florida Institute of Technology with the intention of taking it slow. I wanted to be ready to work when my youngest entered kindergarten in 2020. However, I enjoyed the program so much that I could not pick between classes and graduated three years ahead of schedule. My interest in business management, productivity, job satisfaction, motivation, and training pushed me to work harder and faster than I had anticipated.</p>

			<!-- Why Leora? -->

				<div class="title">Why Leora?</div>
				<div class="container">
					<p class="text200">We spend most of our lives either at work or at home; shouldn’t they be places we enjoy being? This thought has propelled me into both HR and Professional Organization. My passion for facilitating a brighter future and helping others has been a constant in my life. The name Leora is Hebrew in origin, meaning “my light”.  Leora is the perfect name to deliver services intended to create a light at the end of the tunnel and lift the burdens that come with dysfunctional spaces.</p>
					<p class="text200">I have met too many people who dread going to work because they feel overwhelmed and stressed—surrounded by stacks they can’t seem to get to the bottom of. Similarly, there are people who will do everything they can to avoid going home—spending time and money to distract themselves from the endless to-dos waiting for them (for the record, I used to be both of those people). These interactions inspired me to learn how to design cultures and environments that are 	motivating and energizing.</p>
					<p class="text200">Our surroundings impact how we communicate as well as our mindset, habits, and behaviors. Designing spaces and systems with intention and purpose can boost productivity and support personal and professional development.</p>
